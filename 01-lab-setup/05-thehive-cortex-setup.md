# 05 - TheHive + Cortex Setup

> **TheHive turns alerts into cases.** When Wazuh fires a hundred alerts, TheHive is where you triage them into structured incidents, assign them to analysts, track every action taken, and close with documented resolution. Cortex sits alongside it as an automation engine - it takes an IP address from an alert and automatically queries VirusTotal, AbuseIPDB, and Shodan so you don't have to.

- **TheHive**: The case management platform. Think of it as a ticket system purpose-built for security incidents.
- **Cortex**: The automation engine. Analyzers run against observables (IOCs) and return enrichment data automatically.
- Both run on the same Ubuntu VM: **192.168.56.12**
